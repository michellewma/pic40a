                My friend and I really wanted to see a sunset together and grab coffee at a shop we both liked near the beach. It seemed like the perfect hangout idea, except that drinking coffee at night would mean we would probably not be able to sleep. Being the genius that I am, I suggested we watch the sunrise together instead. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We finally chose a day we were both free, and met up at 5 am to go to Santa Monica. The weather channel indicated that the sun would rise at 5:20 am. On the ride there it was still dark outside. We stopped at the pier and started walking along the beach, fully expecting to see an <strong>LA sunset</strong> but in the morning. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When 5:15 rolled around, the sky was bright enough for us to see each other and our surroundings, which we noticed looked awfully foggy. 5:20, which was the time the sun was supposed to rise, passed, and the sky was still bleak. It was then that we realized sunrises are not that much of a thing on the West Coast and it was in fact a foggy day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At least we still had a great chat and some <i>yummy</i> iced coffee!
